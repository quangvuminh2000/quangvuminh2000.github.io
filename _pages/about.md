My name is Quang (*VÅ© Minh Quang*), I grew up in Vung Tau, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³. I would rather being called by my nickname: *Henry Quang*

I'm a graduate Computer Science student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology on 2022. Experience through fundamental subjects ranging from *Computer Architecture, Data Structures and Algorithms, Statistics* upto interesing ones likes: *Cryptographic, Principle of Programming Language, Machine Learning, etc.*. The title of my thesis is "Development of the Deep Learning Models for Depression Diagnoses"

I'm currently working at FPT Telecom as a Data Scientist from August 2022 (aprox. 1yr 8mos). I helped build a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/preprocessing-pgp/) consists of *end-to-end LLMs* and *modern AI systems* to clean/format customer profile infomation such as *Vietnamese names, phones, emails, card numbers, addresses, etc.* I also build an end-to-end website for labelling medical reports for Long Chau medical store [long-chau-labelling](https://lc-labelling-application.onrender.com/auth/login).

Currently, I'm fascinate with Abstract Algebra and Automated Trading ðŸ’¸, so you will probaly see me working on these most of the time.

I am looking to apply to PhD programs for **Fall 2024**.
